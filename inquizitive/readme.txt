For this checkpoint we got most of the models defined that we think we will need for our project, which may change in the future. We also created pages so that users can view all the quizzes in a specific Genre of quiz, and create a Quiz in any of the predefined genres. The quiz creation process is not how we want it to be for our final implementation since currently users have to create a Quiz, then add questions, and subsequent question choices on separate pages. Ideally we would like to have all these things created on a single page in one form, which we will try to improve on for our final implementation. We also got our development and production style deployment fully working, so that we donâ€™t have to worry about handling that at a later stage. Finally, we started styling the default Django templates with some placeholder styling to improve the UI of our website. The styling is very simple at the moment because we were more focussed on getting the functionality in place rather than the styling.
